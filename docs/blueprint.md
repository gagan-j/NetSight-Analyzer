# **App Name**: NetSight Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Network Type Selection: Allow users to select between 4G and 5G network simulations.
- Parameter Configuration: Enable users to configure simulation parameters like modulation, bandwidth, distance, and noise levels.
- Real-time Metric Calculation: Calculate signal strength, BER, and throughput based on configured parameters using established network models.
- Interactive Visualization: Display real-time charts showing Signal Strength vs. Distance, BER vs. SNR, and Throughput vs. Bandwidth, so users can see the correlation.
- Report Generation: Generate and download simulation reports in CSV format.
- AI Parameter Suggestion: Suggest optimal simulation parameters based on user goals such as maximizing throughput or minimizing BER, using a generative AI tool that selects from typical/possible values in the 4g/5g landscape. The LLM will reason about the interdependencies and relationships to create an intelligent guess.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Shades of green to convey eco-friendliness and network health.
- Background color: Use the provided image 'https://osxdaily.com/2024/08/07/get-the-new-macos-sequoia-sunrise-forest-wallpaper/' with a frosted glass effect similar to macOS Tahoe.
- Accent color: A brighter, complementary green to highlight interactive elements and key metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'GitHub' sans-serif, for a modern, objective look. 'GitHub' will be used throughout for its readability and clean appearance.
- Use material design icons to represent network parameters and metrics, styled with a subtle glass effect.
- Dashboard layout with clear sections for parameter configuration, real-time charts, and report generation, all incorporating the frosted glass aesthetic.
